# Ryan's Round Robin

First attempt at making lead round robining easier. No custom fields to be added. Just set a criteria for how leads should be assigned, and that's it.

## Settings

You can create a criteria to match who should be assigned leads based on User fields.

### TODO
- Support more than one criteria. Right now, the first criteria is always used if it exists
